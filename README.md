  * Alerts are stored in an Alerts table and pushed to relevant users.  
* **Low Stock Alerts:**  
  * Triggered when Total\_Quantity\_of\_Product \< reorder\_level for a specific product.  
  * Calculated dynamically when stock moves out or on a scheduled basis.  
* **User Interface:** A dedicated "Alerts" section in the UI showing unread and read alerts. Notifications can appear as badges on icons.

### **Technical Considerations for Enhancement**

* **Database Schema:** Design a robust relational database schema including tables for Products, Batches, Users (Distributors, Retailers), Inventory\_Movements, Alerts, Suppliers, Categories, etc.  
* **API Design (FastAPI):**  
  * Implement RESTful APIs for all inventory operations and data retrieval.  
  * Secure endpoints with authentication (JWT).  
  * Rate limiting to prevent abuse.  
  * User-friendly forms for data entry.  
  * Local database (SQLite) synchronization logic.  
  * Push notification integration.  
* **Dash Integration:**  
  * Host the Dash application and embed it using a WebView component in the mobile app.  
  * Ensure secure communication between the mobile app and the Dash backend.  
* **Scalability:** Consider horizontal scaling for the FastAPI backend and database read replicas as the business grows.  
* **Security:** Implement strong authentication, authorization, data encryption (at rest and in transit), and regular security audits.  
* **Backup & Recovery:** Establish automated daily backups of the cloud database and a disaster recovery plan.
